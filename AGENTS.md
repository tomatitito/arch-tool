# Agent Documentation

## Issue Tracking

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Use the `/beads` skill for full documentation on creating, updating, and managing issues.

## Managing AI-Generated Planning Documents

AI assistants often create planning and design documents during development:
- PLAN.md, IMPLEMENTATION.md, ARCHITECTURE.md
- DESIGN.md, CODEBASE_SUMMARY.md, INTEGRATION_PLAN.md
- TESTING_GUIDE.md, TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md, and similar files

**Best Practice: Use a dedicated directory for these ephemeral files**

**Recommended approach:**
- Create a `history/` directory in the project root
- Store ALL AI-generated planning/design docs in `history/`
- Keep the repository root clean and focused on permanent project files
- Only access `history/` when explicitly asked to review past planning

**Example .gitignore entry (optional):**
```
# AI planning documents (ephemeral)
history/
```

**Benefits:**
- Clean repository root
- Clear separation between ephemeral and permanent documentation
- Easy to exclude from version control if desired
- Preserves planning history for archeological research
- Reduces noise when browsing the project

## Landing the Plane

**When the user says "let's land the plane"**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. The plane is NOT landed until `git push` succeeds. NEVER stop before pushing. NEVER say "ready to push when you are!" - that is a FAILURE.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW - COMPLETE ALL STEPS:**

1. **File bd issues for any remaining work** that needs follow-up
2. **Ensure all quality gates pass** (only if code changes were made) - run tests, linters, builds (file P0 issues if broken)
3. **Update bd issues** - close finished work, update status
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE - NON-NEGOTIABLE** - If there is a remote configured, this step is MANDATORY. Execute ALL commands below:
   ```bash
   # Pull first to catch any remote changes
   git pull --rebase

   # If conflicts in .beads/issues.jsonl, resolve thoughtfully:
   #   - git checkout --theirs .beads/issues.jsonl (accept remote)
   #   - bd import -i .beads/issues.jsonl (re-import)
   #   - Or manual merge, then import

   # Sync the database (exports to JSONL, commits)
   bd sync

   # MANDATORY: Push everything to remote
   # DO NOT STOP BEFORE THIS COMMAND COMPLETES
   git push

   # MANDATORY: Verify push succeeded
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin/main"
   ```

   **CRITICAL RULES:**
   - The plane has NOT landed until `git push` completes successfully
   - NEVER stop before `git push` - that leaves work stranded locally
   - NEVER say "ready to push when you are!" - YOU must push, not the user
   - If `git push` fails, resolve the issue and retry until it succeeds
   - The user is managing multiple agents - unpushed work breaks their coordination workflow

5. **Clean up git state** - Clear old stashes and prune dead remote branches:
   ```bash
   git stash clear                    # Remove old stashes
   git remote prune origin            # Clean up deleted remote branches
   ```
6. **Verify clean state** - Ensure all changes are committed AND PUSHED, no untracked files remain
7. **Choose a follow-up issue for next session**
   - Provide a prompt for the user to give to you in the next session
   - Format: "Continue work on bd-X: [issue title]. [Brief context about what's been done and what's next]"

**REMEMBER: Landing the plane means EVERYTHING is pushed to remote. No exceptions. No "ready when you are". PUSH IT.**

**Example "land the plane" session:**

```bash
# 1. File remaining work
bd create "Add integration tests" -t task -p 2 --json

# 2. Run quality gates (only if code changes were made)
pytest tests/
ruff check src/

# 3. Close finished issues
bd close bd-42 --reason "Completed" --json

# 4. PUSH TO REMOTE - MANDATORY, NO STOPPING BEFORE THIS IS DONE
git pull --rebase
# If conflicts in .beads/issues.jsonl, resolve thoughtfully:
#   - git checkout --theirs .beads/issues.jsonl (accept remote)
#   - bd import -i .beads/issues.jsonl (re-import)
#   - Or manual merge, then import
bd sync        # Export/import/commit
git push       # MANDATORY - THE PLANE IS STILL IN THE AIR UNTIL THIS SUCCEEDS
git status     # MUST verify "up to date with origin/main"

# 5. Clean up git state
git stash clear
git remote prune origin

# 6. Verify everything is clean and pushed
git status

# 7. Choose next work
bd ready --json
```

**Then provide the user with:**

- Summary of what was completed this session
- What issues were filed for follow-up
- Status of quality gates (all passing / issues filed)
- Confirmation that ALL changes have been pushed to remote
- Recommended prompt for next session

**CRITICAL: Never end a "land the plane" session without successfully pushing. The user is coordinating multiple agents and unpushed work causes severe rebase conflicts.**

## Building and Testing

This project uses **sbt** (Scala Build Tool) with Scala 2.13. It's a multi-module project with modules: `ir`, `parser`, `renderer`, `validator`, and `cli`.

### Compile

```bash
# Compile all modules
sbt compile

# Compile a specific module
sbt "parser/compile"
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests across all modules
sbt test

# Run tests for a specific module
sbt "parser/test"
sbt "ir/test"
sbt "validator/test"
```

### Quality Gate for Landing the Plane

Before running `git push`, ensure all tests pass:

```bash
sbt test
```

If tests fail, file a P0 issue with `bd create`:
```bash
bd create "Test failure: [description]" -t bug -p 0 --json
```

## MCP Agent Mail: coordination for multi-agent workflows

What it is
- A mail-like layer that lets coding agents coordinate asynchronously via MCP tools and resources.
- Provides identities, inbox/outbox, searchable threads, and advisory file reservations, with human-auditable artifacts in Git.

Why it's useful
- Prevents agents from stepping on each other with explicit file reservations (leases) for files/globs.
- Keeps communication out of your token budget by storing messages in a per-project archive.
- Offers quick reads (`resource://inbox/...`, `resource://thread/...`) and macros that bundle common flows.

How to use effectively
1) Same repository
   - Register an identity: call `ensure_project`, then `register_agent` using this repo's absolute path as `project_key`.
   - Reserve files before you edit: `file_reservation_paths(project_key, agent_name, ["src/**"], ttl_seconds=3600, exclusive=true)` to signal intent and avoid conflict.
   - Communicate with threads: use `send_message(..., thread_id="FEAT-123")`; check inbox with `fetch_inbox` and acknowledge with `acknowledge_message`.
   - Read fast: `resource://inbox/{Agent}?project=<abs-path>&limit=20` or `resource://thread/{id}?project=<abs-path>&include_bodies=true`.
   - Tip: set `AGENT_NAME` in your environment so the pre-commit guard can block commits that conflict with others' active exclusive file reservations.

2) Across different repos in one project (e.g., Next.js frontend + FastAPI backend)
   - Option A (single project bus): register both sides under the same `project_key` (shared key/path). Keep reservation patterns specific (e.g., `frontend/**` vs `backend/**`).
   - Option B (separate projects): each repo has its own `project_key`; use `macro_contact_handshake` or `request_contact`/`respond_contact` to link agents, then message directly. Keep a shared `thread_id` (e.g., ticket key) across repos for clean summaries/audits.

Macros vs granular tools
- Prefer macros when you want speed or are on a smaller model: `macro_start_session`, `macro_prepare_thread`, `macro_file_reservation_cycle`, `macro_contact_handshake`.
- Use granular tools when you need control: `register_agent`, `file_reservation_paths`, `send_message`, `fetch_inbox`, `acknowledge_message`.

Common pitfalls
- "from_agent not registered": always `register_agent` in the correct `project_key` first.
- "FILE_RESERVATION_CONFLICT": adjust patterns, wait for expiry, or use a non-exclusive reservation when appropriate.
- Auth errors: if JWT+JWKS is enabled, include a bearer token with a `kid` that matches server JWKS; static bearer is used only when JWT is disabled.

## Agent History Search

This project supports **cass** for searching agent conversation history. Use the `/cass` skill for full documentation on searching past sessions, viewing results, and using the memory system.
