{"id":"arch-tool-9ez","title":"Clarify or refactor annotations field in DomainModel","description":"## Investigation Complete\n\n### Findings\n\n1. **Scala Source Code Analysis**\n   - Scala domain models are annotation-free (only compiler annotations like @nowarn)\n   - No framework annotations (@JsonProperty, @Entity, etc.) found in domain layer\n   - Domain models are pure case classes without framework dependencies\n\n2. **SPRING_BOOT_MIGRATION.md Analysis**\n   - Source (Scala): Clean, annotation-free domain models\n   - Target (Kotlin): Requires Spring Boot annotations (@Repository, @Service, @RestController, @Entity)\n   - Annotations are ADDED during rendering, not preserved from source\n   - RenderConfig has flags (useSpringBoot, useJPA) to control annotation generation\n\n3. **Parser Implementation**\n   - ScalaParser interface mentions 'annotations' in documentation\n   - No actual implementation exists yet (skeletal module)\n   - Cannot verify if parser would extract annotations\n\n4. **Renderer Implementation**\n   - KotlinRenderer interface mentions generating Spring Boot annotations\n   - RenderConfig controls which annotations to generate\n   - Annotations determined by rendering policy, not IR data\n\n### Architectural Violation\n\n**The annotations field on DomainModel VIOLATES the IR's language/framework-agnostic principle:**\n\n1. Annotations are framework-specific (Spring, JPA, Jackson)\n2. Source Scala code doesn't have framework annotations\n3. Target Kotlin needs annotations, but WHICH annotations should be determined by rendering configuration, not IR structure\n4. IR should represent domain semantics, not implementation details\n\n### Recommendation: REMOVE annotations field from DomainModel\n\n**Rationale:**\n- Violates IR purity (language/framework-agnostic principle)\n- Scala source has no framework annotations to preserve\n- Kotlin target annotations should be determined by RenderConfig policy\n- Conflates domain representation with rendering concerns\n\n**Alternative Approaches:**\n\nOption 1: Move to RenderConfig (RECOMMENDED)\n- Keep DomainModel pure\n- RenderConfig specifies annotation policy based on ModelType\n- Example: If modelType=Entity AND useJPA=true, renderer adds @Entity\n\nOption 2: Separate AnnotationHints (if needed)\n- Create separate AnnotationHint type for parser-to-renderer communication\n- Keep DomainModel pure\n- Only use if parser needs to signal rendering intent\n\nOption 3: Keep but document as 'source preservation only'\n- Only for rare cases where Scala has annotations to preserve\n- Document that it should NOT be used for generating target annotations\n- Add validation rule: annotations should be empty for pure domain models\n\n**Proposed Action:**\nRemove annotations field from DomainModel.scala and rely on RenderConfig to determine which annotations to generate based on domain model semantics (ModelType, field constraints, etc.).","status":"in_progress","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"jens.kouros@breuninger.de","created_at":"2026-01-13T10:52:58.741854+01:00","created_by":"Jens Kouros","updated_at":"2026-01-13T13:22:39.343441+01:00"}
